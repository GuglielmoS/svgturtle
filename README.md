=========

This is a toy implementation of a part of the LOGO language which produces the output
result in the SVG format.  
I choose this format because it's supported by the majority of the browsers and it's very easy to use.    
If you want to see some code examples, you should look at the examples.lisp file.  
The files produced by the function in this file are in the examples directory.  

All the examples are taken from the [Logo 15-word](http://www.mathcats.com/gallery/15wordcontest.html) challenge and have been adapted for this lisp DSL.
